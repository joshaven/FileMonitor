* major enhancements:
  * API Changs: 
    - Add when_modified method which accepts one or more strings that represent files or directories and a proc callback
      ie: FileMonitor.when_modified(Dir.pwd, "other/file.rb") do |filename| ... end
    - FileMonitor when initialized with a proc can have a global proc, and procs set on individual files override the default callback
    - other minor changes like index_of returning the index of the monitored file
  * RSpec Testing!  Oh yah!
  * Reduced I/O load: Updated method of saving old file state. (if the file is changed and rechecked within a second then it won't be noticed)
  * RDocs! Oh yah!
  * Handle duplicates file entries by overwriting the old watched_item with the new one
  * Add start / stop & halt methods for handling spawns
