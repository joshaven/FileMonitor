* 1 major enhancement:
  * Initial release

=== 0.0.2 2009-09-15

* 1 major enhancement:
  * API Changs: 
    - Add when_modified method which accepts one or more strings that represent files or directories and a proc callback
      ie: FileMonitor.when_modified(Dir.pwd, "other/file.rb") do |filename| ... end
    - FileMonitor when initialized with a proc can have a global proc, and procs set on individual files override the default callback
  * Testing!  Oh yah!
  * Reduced I/O load: Updated method of saving old file state.
